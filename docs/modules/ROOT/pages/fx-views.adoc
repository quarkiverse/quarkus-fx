= @FxView
include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]

`@FxView` allows usage of conventional FX Views.
The goal is to have automatic FXML loading, as well i18n bundle resources just by using the `io.quarkiverse.fx.views.FxView` annotation, based on naming convention.

== Naming conventions

Marking an FX controller with such annotation allows for automatic load of :

* the corresponding `.fxml`
* the `.properties` resource bundle (if any)

By default, the filename is deduced from the controller class name.
For a controller class `MySampleController`, the extension will attempt to load :

* `MySample.fxml`
* `MySample.properties` or a resource corresponding to current locale such as `MySample_fr_CA.properties` for instance

The `Controller` suffix is removed when deducing the filename. From a controller class named `MySample`, same filenames will be retrieved, though it is recommended as a convention to keep the `Controller` suffix.

Also, it is possible to use a custom filename : `@FxView("my-custom-name")` will attempt to load files `my-custom-name.fxml` and resource bundle with name `my-custom-name`.

== Directory lookup

By default, files are retrieved from the classpath root.
Therefore, files directly located under `src/main/resources` will be retrieved.

It can be customised by specifying the property `fx-views-root` (`/` by default).

If we define this property with value `views` :

[source,properties]
----
fx-views-root=views
----

Our project could look like this :

[.literal]
----
src/
└── main/
    └── resources/
        └── views/
            ├── Home.fxml
            ├── Home.css
            ├── Home.properties
            ├── About.fxml
            ├── About.css
            └── About.properties
----
_(Stylesheets can use different names)_

If the view is not found in the root directory, it will look under the subdirectory corresponding to the view name, allowing to have a better organized application (one directory per view).

[.literal]
----
src/
└── main/
    └── resources/
        └── views/
            ├── Home/
            │   ├── Home.fxml
            │   ├── Home.css
            │   └── Home.properties
            └── About/
                ├── About.fxml
                ├── About.css
                └── About.properties
----

== Samples

Some code examples can be found under `samples/fxviews`.

[source,java]
----
@FxView
@Dependent
public class SampleController {

    @FXML
    private void onButtonClick() {
        System.out.println("onButtonClick");
    }
}
----

== Stylesheet live reload

In dev mode, when the `quarkus.fx.stylesheet-reload` property is set to `true` (default value), stylesheets referenced in `.fxml` via the `stylesheets` attribute will support automatic live reload.

Any change made to a stylesheet file in the source directory will be immediately applied.

The properties `quarkus.fx.main-resources` (default: `src/main/resources/`) and `quarkus.fx.target-classes` (default: `target/classes/`) define the source and target directories, enabling the stylesheet in the source directory to replace the one in use.

[.literal]
----
src/
└── main/
    └── resources/
        └── views/
            └── Home/
                └── Home.css
target/
└── classes/
    └── views/
        └── Home/
            └── Home.css
----

The utility class `StylesheetWatchService` can also be used to set up live reload explicitly.

[source,java]
----
StylesheetWatchService.setStyleAndStartWatchingTask(() -> component.getStylesheets(), path);
