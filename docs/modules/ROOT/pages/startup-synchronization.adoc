= Startup synchronization

To synchronize the application with JavaFX readiness, one can use the `FxStartupLatch` bean.

It provides an `await` method that is released when JavaFX app is ready (primary `Stage` instance is available).

That is used in the inner `@RunOnFxThread` to ensure app is ready.

[source, java]
----
@Inject
FxStartupLatch startupLatch;

// Blocking until FX env is ready
startupLatch.await();

// FX is ready
----

Alternatively, the `FxStartupEvent` can be observed.

Example of a `SkipPredicate` that can be used in conjunction with a `@Scheduled`

[source,java]
----
@Singleton
public class FxApplicationNotStarted implements SkipPredicate {

    private volatile boolean started;

    void onFxStartup(@Observes final FxStartupEvent event) {
        this.started = true;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean test(final ScheduledExecution execution) {
        return !this.started;
    }
}
